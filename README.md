### PR Analytics: Volume vs Success Rate (auto-updated)

View the [interactive dashboard](https://prarena.ai) for these statistics.

## Understanding the Metrics

Different AI coding agents follow different workflows when creating pull requests:

- **All PRs**: Every pull request created by an agent, including DRAFT PRs
- **Ready PRs**: Non-draft pull requests that are ready for review and merging
- **Merged PRs**: Pull requests that were successfully merged into the codebase

**Key workflow differences**: Some agents like **Codex** iterate privately and create ready PRs directly, resulting in very few drafts but high merge rates. Others like **Copilot** and **Codegen** create draft PRs first, encouraging public iteration before marking them ready for review.

The statistics below focus on **Ready PRs only** to fairly compare agents across different workflows, measuring each agent's ability to produce mergeable code regardless of whether they iterate publicly (with drafts) or privately.
